===========

This library contains an implementation of DES (Discrete Event Simulation) for communication with RTL simulators and a backup RTL simulator written in python.
In addition there is a UVM like environment with some example interface agents.
This means that this library can be used to handle synchronization, data exchange and verification related staff.
The simulation is an object without any special requirements which greatly simplifies automatization and debugging.
